Before we install all firmware, we need to understand the workflow that Most CNC machines use.

Workflow:

(CAD) --> ((CAM) --> (Post processor)) --> (exported Thingname.nc file) --> (Gcode sender) --> (CNC machine)

The workflow require 3-4 different firmwares. here follows a good workflow setup:

   Fusion 360 / EstlCAM 		-->		Pronterface			-->		CNC machine		
(CAD and CAM with Post processor)		(Used to send the gcode	 			(executes gcode commands)
						file to the CNC machine)
Lets work backwards:

CNC machine:
The MKS GEN 1.4 Board used in the CNC machine uses Marlin to define machine limits,
endstops, feedrates and more. The Marlin bugfix folder attached comes preconfigured for
this particular machine.

The Marlin-bugfix-2.0.x CNC configuration was edited in Visual Studio code
And complied with Auto-build Marlin plugin. VScode and Auto-Build Marlin is
recommended for editing all .h files In the Marlin subfolder and for uploading
to MKS GEN 1.4 motherboard.

Gcode sender:
Repetier host is one of the few programs that can connect to the MKS GEN 1.4 board and has lots of configuration settings,
alternatively use Pronterface to connect and send your Thingname.nc file.

CAD program:
Fusion 360 is a program that works excellent as a CAD and CAM program and has built in post processors. Install guffy1234's post processor if you use this alternative.
There are many free CAD programs available if Fusion 360 is not an option, search the web!

CAM program:
CAM is used to create toolpaths for your endmill. Fusion 360 has a build in CAM program that has many advanced functions.
Free programs exist and work for most applications, but lack in options if you intend to make a more complicated cut.

If you intend to use Fusion 360 as CAM program:

Post processor for Fusion 360 CAM that works with marlin:

To install a local post processor see this installation guide.

If you are using guffy1234's Post processor making your .nc files, you might have to edit and remove a bit of start code to remove a probing command.
This is what the start code should look like

; *** START begin ***
G90
G21
M84 S0
G92 X0 Y0 Z0
; *** START end ***

After homing your machine, move all axis to where you want the origin to be on your work piece.
Upload your Thingname.nc file and (using the modified code above) the machine will automaticly Set zero (using G92 X0 Y0 Z0) and start working from this point.
